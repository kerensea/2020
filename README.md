# Vote 2020

Team Members: Vijay G., Keren S., Asma S., Yoo Jin H

*"Only 64% of the US voting age population was registered to vote in 2016". So, our goal with our project is to educate and encourage all voters to exercise their right to vote.*

Project Description:
Our project aims to educate all people, especially young voters, on the candidates of the 2020 presidential election and encourage voters to take action in order to create a more politically aware America. In order to do this, we built a fun and interactive website that encourages the most powerful group of voters, our youth, to get out to the polls and cast a ballot!
