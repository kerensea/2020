<p class="text">

“We have a huge problem with guns. Assault weapons — military-style firearms designed to fire rapidly — are a threat to our national security, and we should treat them as such, Anyone who pretends there’s nothing we can do is lying — and holding that view should be disqualifying for anyone seeking to lead our country.”<br>

<p class="text">
  <ul class="text">

<p class="text">
  <ul class="text">
